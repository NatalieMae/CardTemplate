# The Game of War 
The purpose of war is to have fun and get the whole deck in your hand.

Deal out the whole deck and make sure to keep all the cards FACE DOWN. 

Each player should flip the first card at the same time; give or take a few seconds. 

The highest card is the Ace and lowest is the 2. There are NO wilds in this game. The person with the highest card number wins the hand. 
ie: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A Ace being the highest 'numbered' card.

If there is a draw then the players will place a card face down in their row. Then they will pull another card and have it face up. Person with the highest numbered card wins the whole hand. (the face down cards are revealed to both players after the thrid card is drawn.) 

** Stretch: I have the basic code for the game and the deck prepared so a version of war can be played. I need to apply the war part of the game to this script and the additional CSS that I would like to add if I have time. Also, I need to add additional code to make the "bonus cards" turn over on their own once the third card is pulled during a "War" round. 



//this section is in reference to script.js lines 81-103 but I am adding more lines and this has gotta go! :) 
//I want the draw part of the game to actually start the war part. 

//I would need to add an additional else loop for when there is a draw

//that draw has to allow for an additional two cards per player to be drawn.

//and in order. so first cards are a draw second cards are face down thrid cards face up who ever wins face up gets all the cards from the hand. 

// the face down cards are the "bonus/reward" for winning the "war" ie hand

 //I beleive I added the correct information to the HTML and to my js files but I believe I need to add more 

  //equations of some sort to get the cards to line up and pull more without the cards going back into the pile too soon.
