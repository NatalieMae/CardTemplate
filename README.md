**The Game of War!**
=========================

The purpose of war is to try to collect the entire deck before the other player does. 

**The Steps**
==========================
1. Deal out the whole deck between two players. 
1. If there are more than two players an additional deck has to be added to the game. 
1. Each players clicks their top card of the deck. 
1. The highest card wins the hand.
1. If the same card is pulled by each player; than a war has to insue. 
1. Two additional card spots are created in each players hand for the war to be played.
1. Each player clicks on their deck until all the spots are filled. The final card pulled that is highest wins the hand. 
1. If for some reason there is another tie an additional 2 more boxes should appear for a double war to insue. 
1. Ace is the highest card in the deck, then King, Queen, etc.. The suite of the card is irrelevant in the game of War.
